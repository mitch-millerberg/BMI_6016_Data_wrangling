* Background and Motivation. Discuss your motivations and reasons for choosing this project, especially any background or research interests that may have influenced your decision. 


* Project Objectives. Provide the primary questions you are trying to answer with your data. What would you like to learn and accomplish? List the benefits of how the data could be useful. 


* Data. From where and how are you collecting your data? If appropriate, provide a link to your data sources.
The Wild West Wranglers will be utilizing data from the All of Us Public Data Browser. We will extract relevant datasets from the Electronic Health Records (EHR) and Genomic Data sections to analyze factors influencing metabolic diseases.
Specifically, we will use the Condition, SNV (Single Nucleotide Variant), and Fitbit datasets. The Condition dataset will provide clinical diagnoses and disease progression information, while the SNV dataset will offer genetic variations that may be associated with metabolic conditions. Additionally, the Fitbit dataset will supply real-world biometric and activity tracking data, allowing us to examine lifestyle factors such as physical activity, heart rate, and sleep patterns.
By integrating these datasets, we aim to investigate how genetic predispositions, lifestyle behaviors, and clinical conditions interact in the development and progression of metabolic diseases. This approach will enable us to conduct meaningful analyses on potential risk factors and identify trends that may inform future public health interventions.
